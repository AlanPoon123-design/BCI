# BCI
BCIs, or Brain-Computer Interfaces, also known as BMIs, or Brain-Machine Interfaces, are devices that process brain activity to control external devices, allowing users to interact with them using their thoughts.  They fall into two main paradigms: invasive, which involves neurological implants, and non-invasive, which involves an electrode headset placed near the scalp.  These types of technology are used in the medical field and for user interaction with machines.

## Brain-Wave Reference:
😪 Delta (0.5–4 Hz) - Deep sleep

🧘 Theta (4–8 Hz) - Drowsiness, meditation

😌 Alpha (8–12 Hz) - Calm focus

⚠️ Beta (13–30 Hz) - Alert, thinking

🤔 Gamma (30–100 Hz) - High-level cognition

## Open-Ended Questions
1.) Why might tests like noisy signals like EEG still be useful in serious tech like brain-computer interfaces?
--- Despite having a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), noisy signals in EEGs are still useful as they .  .  .
